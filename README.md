# 30DaysOfCode
Continuous improvement is key! Not sure where I first read about this, but I just found this post by [lifehack.org](https://www.lifehack.org/788823/continuous-improvement) that highlighted the philosophy of Kaizen, the practice of continuous improvement. This resonated with me a lot, so I decided to set a goal to code every day of October! 

## Requirements 
The daily requirements I set for myself are to do one of the following:
* Do something you haven't done before
* Improve on a piece of work you did
* Report on something I did in an interesting way

## Overview
Topics Explored: Scraping, Multiprocessing, Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), 

Tools I used so far: (Python) concurrent.futures, bs4, requests, multiprocessing, threading, numpy, matplotlib, plotly

## Daily Breakdown
* **Oct 1: (requests, bs4, re, concurrent.futures, nltk, and pandas)** [Scraped readlightnovel.me to create a light-novels dataset](https://github.com/yuvalofek/scraping-light-novel-data)
* **Oct 2: (concurrent.futures, Threading, Multiprocessing)** [A comparison of multi- and single core multiprocessing for matrix multiplication in Python](https://github.com/yuvalofek/MultiprocessingMatMul)
* **Oct 3: (xgboost)** [Implemented xgboost from scratch! (xgboost part 1)](https://github.com/yuvalofek/py_xgboost)
* **Oct 4: (xgboost, boosting)** [Implemented boosting and added to previously created xgboost trees (xgboost part 2)](https://github.com/yuvalofek/py_xgboost)
* **Oct 5: (xgboost, boosting, plotly)** [Finished xgboost project! Added multi-dim input feature and aproximate splitting (xgboost part 3)](https://github.com/yuvalofek/py_xgboost)
* **Oct 6: (git)** Set up [git](https://git-scm.com/) on my PC! (I ran into problems with this before, so I opted to use desktop app/web interface locally and git for remote server work). I also studied unit testing using using PyTest and Circle.ci
* **Oct 7: (SQL, sqlite)*** Tested out sqlite3 for running SQLite
