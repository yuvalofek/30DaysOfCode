# 30DaysOfCode
Continuous improvement is key! Not sure where I first read about this, but I just found this post by [lifehack.org](https://www.lifehack.org/788823/continuous-improvement) that highlighted the philosophy of Kaizen, the practice of continuous improvement. This resonated with me a lot, so I decided to set a goal to code every day of October! 

After going through the almost the entire month (Oct 2021) I realized I really liked the visual aspect of this, so I decided to keep this going indefinitely!

Tracking progress allows me to see my growth and motivates me to keep going :)

## Overview
**Topics Explored:** Scraping, Multiprocessing, Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Visualization, Content Creation, Dimensionality Reduction, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Data Exploration/Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Wrangling, Databases, Statistics, Automation, Data Versioning, Documentation, 

**Tools I used so far:** 
* (Python) _concurrent.futures, bs4, requests, multiprocessing, threading, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, sqlite3, ebooklib, collections, sklearn, pandas;_ (SQL); (C++); (git); (Medium)

## Daily Breakdown
### January 2021
1.  Re-evaluated priorities to start up my learning again!
1.  Watched [Risk at Scale - Running a large investment risk system and how risk analysis techniques can help you
](https://pydata.org/global2021/schedule/presentation/151/risk-at-scale-running-a-large-investment-risk-system-and-how-risk-analysis-techniques-can-help-you/) - fascinating watch about working with risk at large scale and the software choices behind it. 
1. Watched: 
    * [Highly-Scalable NLP to Answer Questions on South Africa’s COVID-19 WhatsApp Hotline](https://pydata.org/global2021/schedule/presentation/100/highly-scalable-nlp-to-answer-questions-on-south-africas-covid-19-whatsapp-hotline/) - Impresive use of NLP to help covid Q&A
    * [Computations as Assets - a New Approach to Reproducibility and Transparency](https://pydata.org/global2021/schedule/presentation/44/computations-as-assets-a-new-approach-to-reproducibility-and-transparency/) -- Introduction to ExAx and some visualizations it allows us to create. I really liked the COVID-19 visualization they did with taxi cars. Added ExAx/Accelerator to my list of thing to learn. 
    * [Darts for Time Series Forecasting](https://pydata.org/global2021/schedule/presentation/28/darts-for-time-series-forecasting/) - Introduction to the Darts library. Seems like a very versatile tool for forecasting, I added it to my list of things to check out.
