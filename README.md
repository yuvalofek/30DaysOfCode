# 30DaysOfCode
Continuous improvement is key! Not sure where I first read about this, but I just found this post by [lifehack.org](https://www.lifehack.org/788823/continuous-improvement) that highlighted the philosophy of Kaizen, the practice of continuous improvement. This resonated with me a lot, so I decided to set a goal to code every day of October! 

## Requirements 
The daily requirements I set for myself are to do one of the following:
* Do something you haven't done before
* Improve on a piece of work you did
* Report on something I did in an interesting way

## Overview
Topics Explored: Scraping, Multiprocessing

Tools I used so far: (Python) concurrent.futures, bs4, requests, multiprocessing, threading

Topics I am interested in looking into: Tableau, lightgbm, xgboost, seaborn (more in depth), pyspark, sklearn (more in depth), unbalanced-learn, scipy.stats (more in depth), statsmodels, prophet, greykite

## Daily Breakdown
* **Oct 1: (requests, bs4, re, concurrent.futures, nltk, and pandas)** [Scraped readlightnovel.me to create a light-novels dataset](https://github.com/yuvalofek/scraping-light-novel-data)
* **Oct 2: (concurrent.futures, Threading, Multiprocessing)** [A comparison of multi- and single core multiprocessing for matrix multiplication in Python](https://github.com/yuvalofek/MultiprocessingMatMul)
* **Oct 3: (xgboost)** [Implemented xgboost from scratch! (xgboost part 1)](https://github.com/yuvalofek/py_xgboost)
* **Oct 4: (xgboost, boosting)** [Implemented boosting and added to previously created xgboost trees (xgboost part 2)](https://github.com/yuvalofek/py_xgboost)
