# 30DaysOfCode
Continuous improvement is key! Not sure where I first read about this, but I just found this post by [lifehack.org](https://www.lifehack.org/788823/continuous-improvement) that highlighted the philosophy of Kaizen, the practice of continuous improvement. This resonated with me a lot, so I decided to set a goal to code every day of October! 

After going through the almost the entire month I realized I really liked the visual aspect of this, so I decided to keep this going indefinitely 
>(After taking a break in November to finish my masters)! 

Tracking progress allows me to see my growth and motivates me to keep going :)

## Overview
**Topics Explored:** Scraping, Multiprocessing, Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Visualization, Content Creation, Dimensionality Reduction, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Data Exploration/Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Wrangling, Databases, Statistics, Automation, Data Versioning, Documentation, 

**Tools I used so far:** 
* (Python) _concurrent.futures, bs4, requests, multiprocessing, threading, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, sqlite3, ebooklib, collections, sklearn, pandas;_ (SQL); (C++); (git); (Medium)
